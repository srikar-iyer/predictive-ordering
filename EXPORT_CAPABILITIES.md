# Chart Export Capabilities

This document provides an overview of the export capabilities added to the Pizza Predictive Ordering System visualizations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Image Export Options

All visualizations now support exporting charts as images in various formats:

- **PNG Format**: High-quality raster images suitable for presentations and reports
- **SVG Format**: Vector graphics for scaling without loss of quality, ideal for publications
- **PDF Format**: Print-ready format that preserves exact chart appearance

### 2. Data Export Functionality

Users can now export the underlying data from any chart in two formats:

- **CSV Format**: Comma-separated values for easy import into spreadsheet applications
- **Excel Format**: Direct export to Microsoft Excel format for analysis

### 3. Export Interface

Export capabilities are accessible through:

- Standard Plotly modebar buttons for PNG export
- Custom dropdown menu in each chart for additional export options
- Consistent interface across all visualization types

### 4. User Documentation

- Help text added to the dashboard explaining export functionality
- Export options explained in the forecast and pricing tab introductions
- Detailed export documentation in the Settings tab

## Implementation Details

### Chart Export Utilities Module

A dedicated `chart_export_utils.py` module was created to handle export functionality:

- `configure_chart_export_buttons()`: Configures Plotly charts with export buttons
- `enhance_figure_with_exports()`: Adds export dropdown menu to Plotly figures
- `extract_figure_data()`: Extracts data from charts for CSV/Excel export
- `prepare_csv_export()`: Prepares CSV data for download
- `prepare_excel_export()`: Prepares Excel data for download
- `configure_dash_app_for_exports()`: Adds necessary JavaScript for data exports

### Integration with Visualization Components

Export capabilities have been integrated with:

- All charts in `plotly_visualizations.py`
- All charts in `integrated_visualizations.py`
- Dashboard charts in `dashboard.py`

### User Interface Enhancements

- Export information added to the Settings tab
- Export capabilities explained in the tab introduction sections
- Consistent export menu styling across all chart types
