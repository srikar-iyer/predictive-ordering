# Interactive Features for Pizza Predictive Ordering System

This document outlines the interactive features implemented in the Pizza Predictive Ordering System dashboard.

## Overview

We've enhanced all visualizations with the following interactive features:

1. **Enhanced Hover Tooltips** - Providing detailed information on data points
2. **Drill-down Capabilities** - Click on data points to explore deeper insights
3. **Zoom and Pan Controls** - Navigate time series and other charts with precision
4. **Crossfiltering Between Charts** - Filter data across multiple visualizations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Hover Tooltips

All charts now display rich tooltips with contextual information when hovering over data points:

- **Sales Forecasts**: Show date, predicted units, confidence intervals, and percent difference from previous periods
- **Price Sensitivity Curves**: Display price point, demand ratio, profit impact, and optimization recommendations
- **Elasticity Charts**: Show product details, elasticity values, margin percentages, and pricing context
- **Inventory Charts**: Display stock levels, reorder points, and coverage metrics

The tooltips are dynamically generated based on the data and chart type, providing relevant insights for each visualization.

### 2. Drill-down Capabilities

Charts support click interactions that open detailed analysis modals:

- **Time Series Charts**: Click on a date to see detailed metrics for that specific day
- **Elasticity Distribution**: Click on a bar to see all products with elasticities in that range
- **Price Sensitivity Curves**: Click on a price point to view detailed profit projections
- **Heatmaps**: Click on cells to see detailed analysis of specific price/inventory combinations

The drill-down functionality provides deeper insights without cluttering the main dashboard view.

### 3. Zoom and Pan Controls

Time series and numeric charts now support:

- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel, selection tools, or pinch gestures (on touch devices)
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move the visible area
- **Range Selector**: Quick options for common time ranges (7d, 1m, 3m, 6m, All)
- **Reset View**: Easily return to the default view

For connected charts (like the integrated view), zoom and pan operations are synchronized across related visualizations.

### 4. Crossfiltering Between Charts

The dashboard implements a crossfiltering system where:

- **Selection in one chart**: Highlights related data in other charts
- **Filtering**: Selecting data points filters other visualizations to show relevant subsets
- **Highlighting**: Selected elements are emphasized while others are de-emphasized
- **Clear Filters**: Reset all filters with a single click

This allows for interactive exploration of relationships between different metrics and dimensions.

## Technical Implementation

The interactive features are implemented using:

1. **Plotly.js Extensions**: Enhanced the base Plotly charts with custom configurations
2. **Client-side Callbacks**: JavaScript functions for responsive interactions
3. **Dash Components**: Hidden components for maintaining state across interactions
4. **CSS Customizations**: Styling to improve the visual feedback of interactions

### Key Files

- `src/models/interactive_features.py`: Core Python functions for enhancing charts
- `ui/interactive_callbacks.py`: Dashboard callback functions for interactive features
- `assets/interactive.js`: Client-side JavaScript for handling interactions
- `assets/interactive.css`: Styling for interactive elements

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Exploring Price Sensitivity

1. Navigate to the Pricing tab
2. Hover over the price sensitivity curve to see projected demand at different price points
3. Click on an interesting price point to view detailed profit analysis
4. Use the zoom tools to focus on a specific price range of interest

### Example 2: Analyzing Forecast and Inventory Relationships

1. Navigate to the Integrated View tab
2. Select a date range using the range selector buttons
3. Click on a peak in the forecast chart to drill down into that day's metrics
4. Select a period of high demand to see how it affects inventory levels in the chart below

### Example 3: Comparing Products

1. Navigate to the Summary tab
2. Select multiple products using the lasso or box select tools
3. Observe how the selection filters other charts to show only the selected products
4. Compare metrics across the filtered selection

## Browser Compatibility

The interactive features are fully supported in:
- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

For older browsers, basic interactivity is maintained but some advanced features may be limited.

## Performance Considerations

The interactive features use efficient client-side processing to ensure responsiveness even with large datasets. For very large data visualizations, some features may automatically adjust to maintain performance.
