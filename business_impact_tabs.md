# Business Impact Tabs Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of business impact tabs for the Pizza Predictive Ordering System dashboard.

## Overview

Three new tabs were added to provide business impact analysis:

1. **Profit Analysis Tab** - Analyzes profit metrics and displays visualizations of profit impact
2. **Revenue Analysis Tab** - Provides revenue breakdown and trend analysis 
3. **Loss Prevention Tab** - Identifies sources of loss and opportunities for prevention

## Features

### Profit Analysis Tab
- KPI cards showing total profit impact, positive/negative impact counts, and highest profit item
- Profit impact waterfall chart displaying contribution by product
- Profit trend analysis with moving average

### Revenue Analysis Tab
- KPI cards showing baseline revenue, projected revenue, revenue change, and top revenue product
- Revenue breakdown by product category visualization
- Revenue trend analysis with moving average

### Loss Prevention Tab
- KPI cards showing waste cost, stockout cost, total loss impact, and loss prevention opportunity
- Loss breakdown analysis by category
- Loss prevention opportunities visualization

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the existing tab structure pattern in the codebase:

1. Created a new module `ui/business_impact.py` that contains:
   - Tab content creation functions for each business impact tab
   - Visualization callbacks for interactive charts
   - Data processing functions for business metrics

2. Updated core UI components in `ui/core.py`:
   - Added new tab definitions to `create_tab_layout()`
   - Added new content containers in `create_tab_content()`

3. Updated the main dashboard in `ui/dashboard.py`:
   - Imported business impact module functions
   - Added new tabs to the tab navigation
   - Updated the tab content render function
   - Registered business impact callbacks

## Usage

The new tabs can be accessed from the main dashboard navigation. Each tab provides:
- Store selection dropdown
- Time range selection dropdown
- Interactive visualizations that respond to selections
- Key performance indicators
- Detailed charts for specific metrics

## Data Sources

The business impact tabs use the following data sources:
- `combined_data` - For historical sales and pricing data
- `profit_impact` - For profit impact analysis
- `price_elasticities` - For price sensitivity data
- `inventory_projection` - For inventory and stockout analysis

When specific data is not available, the tabs will display simulated data for demonstration purposes.
